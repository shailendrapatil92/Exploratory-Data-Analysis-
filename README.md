Using R

The repository contains analysis on various datasets using R.
To get a quick look , go to the below links which has the pdf. To get access to RMD files navigate to the corresponding folders.

Analysis1:

The folder contains analysis of tips.txt data. Analyzed the distribution of data (center, spread, and shape of its distribution). "tip in dollars"
